# Dispatch Salesforce Commerce Cloud Cartridge
This repository contains Dispatch's integrations with Salesforce Commerce Cloud platform.

Your implementation will allow your business to start selling in new channels with Dispatch, while having orders and payments processed through Salesforce Commerce Cloud B2C and your existing payment service provider (PSP), just like your businessâ€™s core ecommerce website. Dispatch currently supports:

1. Stripe Payments
2. Adyen Payments
3. *Contact us to add your PSP*

Currently Dispatch is available for Salesforce Reference Architecture (SFRA) websites. A SiteGenesis Javascript Controller (SGJS) version will be available soon.

## Documentation

Note that Stripe requires modification of the [Stripe SFCC Connector](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-sfcc-b2c-connector). The Documentation folder contains these snippets and examples.
